**Team Name:** AI’m Fine

## Product Description

DiagnoAI is a web-based healthcare support platform that leverages artificial intelligence to facilitate the flow of medical information between patients, doctors, and educators/students. The system translates patients’ self-expressed symptoms into medical language using NLP and classifies their urgency level through an AI-driven triage mechanism. Doctors receive concise and meaningful reports to accelerate diagnosis and intervention.

Additionally, DiagnoAI identifies rare medical cases and labels them for educational use. This dual-purpose approach both reduces doctors’ workload and enhances medical students' exposure to rare cases by allowing AI-assisted analysis and feedback. DiagnoAI aims to modernize doctor–patient communication and enrich healthcare education through smart Technologies

---

## Primary Function

Patients enter their personal information and symptoms into the platform. An AI-generated pre-diagnosis and triage report is automatically created, classifying patients into green, yellow, or red urgency zones. This report is then transmitted to the doctor, who can review it and write their diagnosis or comments in a free-form section. All data is securely saved in the system database.

---

## Secondary Function

The platform automatically detects and labels rare cases, which are then transferred to the student and educator module. Students analyze these cases by entering their diagnoses and reasoning. The system evaluates the answers and provides instant feedback. Educators can monitor student performance and use the platform as a digital learning tool.

---

## Key Features

- Free-form symptom entry allowing patients to describe their issues in their own words  
- NLP-powered medical translation of patient narratives, even with slang or nonstandard terms  
- AI-based triage classification system (green, yellow, red)  
- Doctor dashboard to view detailed patient reports and enter medical evaluations  
- Rare case interface for students with AI-generated feedback and scoring  
- Custom login and UI for each user role: Patient, Doctor, and Educator  
- Prompt-based AI output generation and structured testing of 30–40 prompts  
- Secure database for storing medical history, symptoms, and treatment records  

---

## Target Audience

- Patients  
- Doctors  
- Medical students  
- Instructors

## Sprint 1

- **Sprint duration:** 16 days  
- **Sprint target score:** 100 points  
- **Actual score:** 100 points (5 main tasks completed)  
- **Total number of project sprints:** 3  
- **Total workload:** 300 points  

Estimated score to be completed within the sprint: 100 Points

  **Score completion logic:**  
The project was planned as 3 sprints and it was anticipated to reach a total of approximately 300 points of work. Priority tasks such as basic system components such as patient interface, symptom processing, and artificial intelligence-based first output production were planned in 

Tasks were evaluated in the range of 5–13 points according to their difficulty level and organized in lists such as “Tasks”, “Frontend Backlogs”, “File Goals” on the Trello board.

---

  ## Daily Scrum

Daily Scrum meetings were conducted in writing via the WhatsApp group due to time constraints. The team shared important decisions and developments here instantly. Weekly online meetings were held via Google Meet, task sharing, design reviews and AI trials were conducted in coordination.

---

  ## Sprint Board

- **Tasks:** Main work items (symptom input, AI output, recommendation system, etc.)  
- **File Goals:** Model goals, technical task descriptions  
- **Frontend Backlogs:** UI tasks separated by user types  
- **Required Documents:** Design templates, meeting notes, training content  
- **1. Sprint – 3. Sprint:** Areas where tasks will be distributed based on sprint  

---

  ## Sprint 1 – Completed Tasks

- The project idea was solidified based on the goal of reducing emergency room congestion through an AI-powered triage and patient evaluation system.  
- Design research was conducted, including analysis of existing medical interfaces using tools like Figma, Canva, and healthcare-related UI/UX patterns.  
- Project management infrastructure was set up, with Trello used for task tracking, a WhatsApp group for daily communication, and Google Meet scheduled for team meetings.  
- Initial experimentation with the AI model began, focusing on NLP-based sentence processing, prompt design trials, and testing early outputs of the model.  
- The patient interface was designed, including screens for symptom input and user flow, enabling patients to describe their condition in natural language.  
- The educator interface was also initiated, starting with the layout and logic for rare case analysis and student response functionality.  

---

  ## Sprint Review

- Idea validation  
- UI and user scenario creation  
- First versions of patient and trainer screens  
- Testing sample scenarios for model tests  
- Clarification of project team processes  

  **Notes:**  
- Doctor panel and database integration were transferred to Sprint 2.  
- Prompt tests were planned but not fully implemented.

---

  ## Sprint Retrospective

  **What's Going Well:**

- Team communication was successful (WhatsApp + Google Meet)  
- Design and idea generation was very efficient  
- Tasks were well organized via Trello  

  **Improvement Required:**

- AI side tests should be measured with more concrete metrics  
- Frontend tasks should be divided into smaller steps  

---

  ## Tools Used

- **Trello:** Task tracking and sprint planning  
- **Figma:** UI design and wireframe prototyping  
- **Canva:** Visual research and layout inspiration  
- **WhatsApp:** Daily team communication  
- **Google Meet:** Weekly team meetings and discussion sessions  
- **Python + NLP:** AI model experimentation and symptom processing
