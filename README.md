# Team Name: AI’m Fine 

## Product Description

DiagnoAI is a web-based healthcare support platform that leverages artificial intelligence to facilitate the flow of medical information between patients, doctors, and educators or students. The system utilizes natural language processing techniques to translate patients’ self-expressed symptoms into medical terminology, and determines each case’s urgency level through an AI-powered triage mechanism. In this way, doctors receive concise and meaningful reports that accelerate diagnostic and intervention processes. The platform also automatically identifies and labels rare medical cases for educational purposes; this dual-purpose approach both eases the workload of doctors and enables medical students and educators to perform interactive AI-assisted analyses on rare cases and receive instant feedback. All data is securely stored in the system database. DiagnoAI aims to modernize doctor–patient communication and enhance healthcare education with smart Technologies

### Sprint Notes

•	The project vision was clarified as an AI-powered triage and patient assessment solution aimed at reducing emergency room overcrowding.  
•	Design research was conducted using Figma, Canva, and analyses of healthcare-specific UI/UX patterns.  
•	The foundational infrastructure for task tracking (Trello), daily team communication (WhatsApp), and weekly meetings (Google Meet) was established.  
•	Initial AI experiments were launched for NLP-based sentence processing and prompt design, and preliminary outputs were achieved.  
•	For patients: the first versions of the symptom entry screens and user flow were prepared; for medical students and educators: initial versions of rare case analysis and evaluation screens were developed.  

### Estimated score to be completed within the sprint

100 points  

### Score completion logic

The project was planned as 3 sprints and it was anticipated to reach a total of approximately 300 points of work. Priority tasks such as basic system components such as patient interface, symptom processing, and artificial intelligence-based first output production were planned in  
Tasks were evaluated in the range of 5–13 points according to their difficulty level and organized in lists such as “Tasks”, “Frontend Backlogs”, “File Goals” on the Trello board.

### Daily Scrum

Daily Scrum meetings were conducted in writing via the WhatsApp group due to time constraints. The team shared important decisions and developments here instantly. Weekly online meetings were held via Google Meet, task sharing, design reviews and AI trials were conducted in coordination.
